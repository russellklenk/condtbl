Current settings build using VS2017. You can also build using 2013 or 2015 by editing the VSVERSION in setenv.cmd.

To build, open a command prompt and cd to the condtbl directory. 
Type setenv to run setenv.cmd. This sets the MSVC environment variables.
Then type build to run build.cmd. This compiles the application in the build directory.
You can also type 'build debug' to build a debug version.

The only platform-specific bit is the timing code, which currently uses Win32 QueryPerformanceCounter.
